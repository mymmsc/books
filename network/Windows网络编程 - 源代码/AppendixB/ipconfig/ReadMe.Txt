    This sample illustrates how to programmatically retrieve IP configuration
    information similar to the ipconfig.exe utility.  It demonstrates how to 
    use the IP Helper APIs GetNetworkParams() and GetAdaptersInfo().

    To execute this application, simply build the application using the Microsoft 
    Visual C++ (Version 5 SP 3 or newer) nmake.exe program generation utility to 
    make an executable ipconfig.exe.  After the build is complete, simply execute 
    the resulting ipconfig.exe program.
